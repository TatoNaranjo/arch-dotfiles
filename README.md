## ¿What is Arch Dotfiles?
This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Arch Linux, crafted to create a highly customized and efficient desktop environment based in Catppuccin Mocha Theme. The setup primarily utilizes Hyprland as the window manager, Zsh as the shell, and Alacritty as the terminal emulator, all styled with dynamic color schemes generated by pywal. This collection is perfect for power users and tinkerers who enjoy fine-tuning their system to perfection.
